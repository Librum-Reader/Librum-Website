            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">What are cookies?</h2>

            <p>Cookies are often referred to as any type of data storage and retrieval system used to store and access data on a
                user's electronic device (such as a computer, mobile phone, or tablet).</p>
            <p>The term "cookies" is used in this context to refer to other related technologies such as local shared objects, flash
                cookies, web beacons, bugs, etc. as well as the use of fingerprinting techniques, which refer to methods of
                extracting a device's digital fingerprint.</p>
            <p>Websites or Applications are required to ask users for their consent before using cookies in order to comply with
                privacy laws and regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the U.S.
                legislation (including CCPA) in the United States. These regulations are meant to safeguard people's personal
                information and privacy when they use websites and other online resources.</p>
            <p>When a website asks for a user's consent to use cookies, it shows transparency regarding the information it collects
                and how it uses it. The website also gives users control over their personal data and the option to decide whether or
                not to share it by obtaining their approval.</p>
            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">What are cookies used for?</h2>

            <p>Cookies can monitor user activity and gather information to enhance user experience or advertising. Despite the fact
                that it may be a useful tool for businesses, it may also give rise to privacy and security issues.</p>
            <p>We use both our own and third-party cookies for several objectives, including identifying you as a user, learning
                about your browsing habits, collecting statistics, customizing the way content is displayed, and enhancing the
                offerings of goods and services we present to you.</p>
            <p>When you open the Settings Panel, you may view the list of cookies to understand the exact goals of each cookie.</p>

            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">Your Consent regarding these Cookies</h2>

            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">Information about other tracking technologies, like web beacons:</h2>
            <p>Cookies are not the only method for identifying or tracking website visitors. On occasion, we might also employ other related technologies, such as web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These tiny graphics files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an email including them.</p>
            <p>This enables us to track user movement from one page of a website to another, send cookies to your computer or device, determine whether you arrived there via a third-party website, enhance the website's functionality, and assess the efficacy of email marketing campaigns. These technologies frequently rely on cookies to operate effectively. Therefore, disabling cookies will make them less functional.</p>
            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">Cookies and Personal data protection:</h2>
            <p>Some cookies may process personal data, such as when a user's name or email address is used to identify the user (for example, as a registered user), when an IP address is used to identify and track a user, or when a user is identified by a unique identifier (for example, an advertising ID) to distinguish and track a user. For additional information, please check the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2 className="legal-text-subtitle">Changes to the Cookies Policy:</h2>
            <p>This Cookies Policy may be modified at any time if new laws become effective or if the type of cookies being used changes. We always mention the updation date for our policy; therefore, please check coming back to check it.</p>
